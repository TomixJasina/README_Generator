  ## Description 
  
  This project focuses on building a command-line application leveraging Node.js and npm expertise, with a special emphasis on utilizing the Inquirer package. The primary objective is to streamline the process of generating a polished README.md file by capturing user input interactively. By automating the README creation, users can expedite the documentation phase and allocate more time to actual project development. This endeavor has significantly enhanced my proficiency in Node.js and npm, particularly through hands-on experience with the Inquirer package.
